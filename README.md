# IPL-Match-Win-Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict the winners of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning techniques. 
The Indian Premier League is one of the most popular cricket leagues globally, attracting millions of viewers and substantial betting interest. 
This project leverages data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide insights into match outcomes.

## Features
- Predicts the winner of IPL matches based on historical data.
- Utilizes machine learning models to analyze various factors influencing match outcomes.
- Provides probabilistic predictions, offering insights into the uncertainty associated with predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical IPL match data, including team ball by ball data, player performance metrics, match venue, toss outcome, total runs scored, etc. 
The dataset has been collected from kaggle dataset.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Data is collected from various sources and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
2. Model Development: Different machine learning algorithms are explored, to predict IPL match winners.
3. Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.
4. Results Analysis: The project provides insights into the reliability and uncertainty of predicted outcomes, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
